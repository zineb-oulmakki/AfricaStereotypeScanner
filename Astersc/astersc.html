  <aside id=generalization> Do you really mean the whole entire continent? Africa is often treated as a country, and Africans depicted as a monolith! If it's relevant, try to be more specific. <a href="#">Learn more about the "Africa is a country" trope here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=tribalism> African issues are often reduced to matters of ethnicity and tribal rivalries, even when that is an incomplete or inaccurate picture. African communities and groups are often described as tribes regardless of social organization, when similar groups would be described as nations, minority groups, or communities elsewhere in the world. The idea of Africans as tribesmen is harmful and portrays the continent as primitive! <a href="#">Learn more about the Tribalism and Ethnocentrism Trope here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=archaism> Africa is depicted as a continent stuck in the past, perpetually lagging behind the rest of the world. At best, it is romanticized as a place where every practice is ancient tradition, preserved and immutable. At worst, it is imagined as archaic, primitive, and barbaric. Either way, these stereotypes are harmful, and we should carefully choose our words to avoid perpetuating them. <a href="#">Learn more about the Archaism and Underdevelopment trope here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=darkness> To this day, Africa is seen as a place ridden with disease, poverty, famine, war, and devastation. While crises situations continue to unfold in certain regions of the continent, the language used to describe them is often particularly bleak and fatalistic. As the 'Dark Continent' stereotype continues to be one of the most harmful ones to Africa's image, it is worth interrogating whether we are seeing the continent through too negative and alarmist a lens. <a href="#">Find out more here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=nature> People love to describe the savannah, the jungles, the wildlife, and the vast empty lands of Africa. Fascinating and thrilling as they are, descriptions of African landscapes and nature should be used carefully. Africa has long been portrayed as an unadultered natural reservation; a big virgin jungle to tame and explore. If it is not directly related to your subject matter, spare your readers the romanticized natural descriptions. <a href="#">Read more about the Nature and Landscapes Trope here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=light> The sun in Africa is the same sun as anywhere else on the planet! The fascination with the African light and sun is very much the product of a long history of colonial writings. Unless you're writing about solar power or other relevant topic, those descriptions of breathtaking crimson African sunsets are best left off your piece. <a href="#">Learn more about the Light and Sun Trope here.</a> </aside>
  <aside id=corruption> Africa is a corrupt, undemocratic continent ruled by an old boys' club of strongmen and dictators. At least that's what the media says. Despite the fact that there are several autocratic regimes elsewhere, the state of African governance and democracy is depicted as particularly appaling. In the news, African leaders become dictators and governments become regimes a little too fast, so it's critical to consider our biases and be careful in the language we use to describe governance on the continent. <a href="#">Read more about the Political Corruption Trope here.</a> </aside></div>
